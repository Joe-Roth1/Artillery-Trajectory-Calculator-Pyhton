# Artillery-Trajectory-Calculator-Pyhton
This was for a project to calculate parabolic trajectories specifically for Napolean-era artillery cannons to reach half a mile

Just edit the initial velocity theta and time 
I have one for shooting the cannon from a fixed height as well 
I have a separate program for recommended estimates to try 

Feel free to mess around with it
